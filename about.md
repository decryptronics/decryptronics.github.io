Hi! My name is `Soumil Krishnanand Heble` and I'm hooked on to electronics since 2010. This blog is about my personal experiences and adventures in Electronics and Silicon Design.

A Computer Engineer by profession, working at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en" target="_blank">AMD Inc.</a> since 2020 as a Silicon Design Engineer. I work on supporting emulation efforts and verification of AMD's flagship x86 Cores.

I got a **Masters Degree** in **Computer Engineering** from the <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">North Carolina State University</a>, NC, USA and a **Bachelors Degree** in **Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering** from <a href="https://vit.ac.in/" target="_blank">VIT University</a>, TN, India.
